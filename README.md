This project was created as part of my web development course on Udemy. The objective was to replicate an existing website using HTML and CSS to showcase the skills I acquired in web layout and styling.

# Project Description
I replicated the BBC website using HTML and CSS. I aimed to maintain the structure and appearance of the original site as closely as possible, ensuring a good user experience.

# Technologies Used
HTML
CSS

# Usage Instructions
Clone this repository to your computer.
Open the index.html file in your browser to view the replica of the website.

# Additional Notes
This project was created for learning purposes and is a replica of the original website.
Interactive elements, such as forms or backend functionality, are not implemented in this replica.
I strived to replicate the design of the original site to the best of my ability, but there may be some minor differences.
